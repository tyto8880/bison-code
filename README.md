# BISON (BI Stream Optimization Network)
This repo contains the complex event processing prototypes created as a portion of BI Incorporated's University of Colorado capstone project.
Each directory within this repo holds a separate solution prototype and a detailed description of how to run the provided demos.  

### Important Note 
All of these prototypes have been tested on both Windows and Linux operating systems. We don't foresee their being any issues running them on Mac, 
but we can not guarentee this assumption.
